Just tell me 🔥

Create AI rules to auto-generate content per campaign

Map campaigns to CRM leads & deals

Show multi-platform posting logiculti-platform posting logic

Perfect — this is where your platform moves from “social tool” → real CRM-grade system.
I’ll give you production-level architecture, not marketing fluff.

I’ll break this into 3 clear sections, exactly as you asked.

1️⃣ AI RULES TO AUTO-GENERATE CONTENT PER CAMPAIGN

Think of AI as campaign → content factory, governed by rules.

🔹 Core Principle

Campaign defines intent → AI generates compliant content variations

AI should never free-post.
It must obey campaign rules.

🧠 Campaign → AI Rule Engine
Campaign inputs (required)
campaign:
  objective: sales | leads | awareness | hiring
  industry: construction | real_estate | retail | etc
  target_audience: homeowners | SMEs | executives
  platforms: [facebook, instagram, linkedin]
  tone: professional | casual | promotional
  duration: 14 days
  frequency: 3 posts/week
  CTA: "Book a Quote"

🤖 AI Content Generation Rules
Rule 1: Objective → Content Type Mapping
Objective	Content Types AI can generate
Sales	Promotions, product highlights, urgency posts
Leads	Educational posts, lead magnets, CTAs
Awareness	Brand stories, tips, behind-the-scenes
Hiring	Job posts, culture videos, testimonials
Rule 2: Platform-Specific Constraints

AI must generate per platform, not copy-paste.

Platform	Rules
Facebook	Medium length, CTA buttons
Instagram	Short captions, hashtags, reels
LinkedIn	Professional tone, value-first
X	Short, punchy, hashtags
Rule 3: Frequency Rule
max_posts_per_day_per_platform = 1
min_hours_between_posts = 12


AI should schedule, not spam.

Rule 4: Campaign Consistency Rule

All AI-generated content must inherit:

Campaign CTA

Campaign tags

Tracking links (UTMs)

Visual style (brand kit)

🧪 Example AI Output (from ONE campaign)

Campaign: Property Listings – January
AI generates:

Facebook post: Property walkthrough

Instagram reel: 15-sec highlight

LinkedIn post: Market insight + listing

Reminder post: Open house countdown

All auto-linked to campaign

2️⃣ MAP CAMPAIGNS TO CRM LEADS & DEALS

This is where Buffer stops — and CRMOne starts.

🔗 Core Relationship Model
Campaign
 ├── Content
 │    └── Clicks / Views
 │
 └── Leads
      └── Deals
           └── Revenue

🧱 CRM Data Model
Campaign
campaign_id
objective
budget

Lead
lead_id
source = campaign_id
content_id
platform

Deal
deal_id
lead_id
value
stage

🔍 How leads get linked automatically
Rule 1: Tracking links (mandatory)

Every AI-generated post includes:

utm_campaign=black_friday
utm_content=post_3
utm_platform=facebook

Rule 2: Lead capture sources

Landing pages

Contact forms

WhatsApp clicks

Phone calls

Lead ads (Meta / Google)

All mapped back to:

campaign_id + content_id

📊 CRM Intelligence Examples

Campaign Dashboard

Leads generated

Deals created

Revenue closed

Cost per lead

ROI

Deal View

“This deal originated from:
Black Friday Campaign → Instagram Reel #2”

🧠 AI Insights You Can Add Later

“This campaign converts best on Instagram”

“Educational posts generate higher-quality leads”

“LinkedIn deals close at higher value”

3️⃣ MULTI-PLATFORM POSTING LOGIC (IMPORTANT)

This is where most systems get it wrong.

❌ WRONG way (common tools)

One post → blasted to all platforms

This kills reach and engagement.

✅ CORRECT way (professional logic)
1 Content Intent → N Platform Variants
Content Intent
 ├── Facebook version
 ├── Instagram version
 ├── LinkedIn version


Each variant has:

Different caption

Different length

Different hashtags

Different media format (if needed)

🧩 Content Object Model
ContentIntent {
  id
  campaign_id
  theme
}

PlatformPost {
  content_intent_id
  platform
  caption
  media
  scheduled_at
  status
}

🔁 Posting Flow (System Logic)

User / AI creates Content Intent

AI generates platform-specific versions

User approves or edits

Scheduler posts per platform

Metrics flow back to:

PlatformPost

ContentIntent

Campaign

📆 Example: One Intent → Many Posts

Intent: “New Construction Project Update”

Facebook: Project photos + CTA

Instagram: Reel + hashtags

LinkedIn: Progress update + value insight

🚦 Failure Handling (important)

If Instagram fails:

Facebook & LinkedIn still publish

Campaign continues

Error logged per platform

🔐 Permission & Role Rules

AI cannot publish without approval (configurable)

Editors can edit platform variants

Managers approve campaigns

Admins see ROI

🧠 Why this architecture matters

This design allows you to:

Scale to thousands of clients

Add new platforms easily

Run AI safely

Produce CRM-grade reporting

Compete with HubSpot / Salesforce-lite

🚀 NEXT (recommended)

I can:

Design Campaign Detail Page UI

Write Supabase table schemas

Define AI prompt templates per campaign

Design automation triggers

Show WhatsApp + Email campaigns using same logic

Say which one you want next 👌

do all

Done ✅
I’ve created a full end-to-end architecture document in the canvas covering everything you asked for, at production / CRMOne / HubSpot-grade level.

What you now have (all in one place)

✅ Campaign Detail Page UI (exact tabs & responsibilities)

✅ Supabase database schemas (ready for implementation)

✅ AI rules + prompt templates (safe, controllable AI)

✅ Automation triggers (campaign → content → CRM)

✅ Correct multi-platform posting logic (no copy-paste mistakes)

✅ CRM lead & deal attribution (true ROI tracking)

✅ WhatsApp + Email campaigns using the same engine

✅ Roles & permissions model

This is not conceptual — it’s build-ready architecture.

How I recommend you proceed (next best steps)

Pick one and I’ll go deep immediately:

1️⃣ Convert this into Supabase SQL migrations + RLS policies
2️⃣ Design the Campaign Detail Page wireframe (desktop + mobile)
3️⃣ Write exact AI prompts per objective (sales, leads, awareness)
4️⃣ Define event-driven automations (Supabase + Edge Functions)
5️⃣ Show how to plug this into Meta, Google, LinkedIn APIs
6️⃣ Map this directly into your Business Partner app roadmap

Just tell me the number — we’ll build it like a real product, not a demo 🚀

5

Perfect choice 👍
This is the hard part most platforms get wrong, so I’ll show you real-world, production-safe integration logic for:

Meta (Facebook & Instagram), Google, LinkedIn
connected cleanly into your Campaign → Content → CRM engine

No fluff, no SDK magic thinking.

🔌 HOW TO PLUG INTO META, GOOGLE & LINKEDIN APIs (PROPERLY)

We’ll cover:

Overall integration architecture

Meta (Facebook & Instagram)

Google (YouTube + Business + Ads-ready)

LinkedIn

Posting, analytics, failures, permissions

How this ties back to Campaigns & CRM

1️⃣ HIGH-LEVEL INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
Core rule

Your system is the source of truth — not the platforms

Platforms are execution channels, not owners of data.

Recommended architecture
Frontend (Dashboard)
   |
Supabase (DB + Auth)
   |
Edge Functions (OAuth + Posting)
   |
Social Platform APIs

Why Edge Functions?

Secure (no secrets in frontend)

Async posting

Retry & failure handling

Token refresh

Webhook ingestion

2️⃣ META (Facebook + Instagram)
What Meta allows

Facebook Pages posting

Instagram Business posting

Insights (reach, engagement)

Comments (limited)

⚠️ No personal profiles

Meta OAuth scopes (minimum)
pages_manage_posts
pages_read_engagement
pages_show_list
instagram_basic
instagram_content_publish

OAuth flow (Meta)

User clicks “Connect Facebook”

Meta OAuth popup

User selects:

Facebook Page(s)

Linked Instagram account(s)

You store:

Page ID

IG Business ID

Long-lived access token

Store connection in DB
social_accounts (
  id uuid,
  platform text, -- facebook / instagram
  account_id text,
  page_id text,
  access_token text,
  expires_at timestamptz
)

Posting flow (Meta)
Campaign Active
 → PlatformPost scheduled
 → Edge Function triggers
 → POST to Meta Graph API
 → Save post_id
 → Update status

Example: Facebook post
POST /{page-id}/feed
message=caption
link=tracked_url

Instagram (2-step publish!)

Create media container

Publish media container

⚠️ This is why IG posts must be async

3️⃣ GOOGLE (YouTube + Business Profile)

Google is fragmented — treat each as a channel, not one API.

Google OAuth scopes (example)
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/business.manage

Supported content types
Channel	What you can do
YouTube	Upload videos, titles, descriptions
Google Business	Posts, updates, offers
Google Ads	Campaign sync (optional later)
Posting logic (YouTube example)
POST /youtube/v3/videos
title
description
tags
privacyStatus


Mapped from:

PlatformPost.caption
PlatformPost.media
Campaign.utm_tags

4️⃣ LINKEDIN (MOST STRICT)

LinkedIn is strict but powerful for B2B CRM linkage.

LinkedIn OAuth scopes
w_member_social
r_organization_social

Supported posting

Personal profile (limited)

Company Pages (recommended)

Posting flow

Resolve author:

Person URN or Organization URN

Create share

Attach media (if any)

LinkedIn API gotcha

Media upload = multi-step

Rate limits are aggressive

Caption tone must be professional (AI rule!)

5️⃣ MULTI-PLATFORM POSTING ENGINE (IMPORTANT)
Correct internal logic
ContentIntent
 ├── PlatformPost (Facebook)
 ├── PlatformPost (Instagram)
 ├── PlatformPost (LinkedIn)


Each PlatformPost contains:

Platform-specific caption

Media format

Tracking link

Scheduled time

Access token reference

Posting scheduler (pseudo)
if (now >= scheduled_at) {
  postToPlatform(platform)
}


Failures:

Retry x times

Mark failed

Notify user

Campaign continues

6️⃣ ANALYTICS & WEBHOOK INGESTION
Pull-based metrics (cron)

Likes

Reach

Engagement

Clicks

Webhooks (where supported)

Comments

Mentions

Message events

Stored as:

platform_metrics (
  platform_post_id,
  metric,
  value,
  timestamp
)

7️⃣ CRM CAMPAIGN ATTRIBUTION (FULL LOOP)
Every post includes:
utm_campaign
utm_content
utm_platform

Lead creation

When a user:

Submits a form

Clicks WhatsApp

Calls

Sends email

You create:

Lead {
  campaign_id
  content_id
  platform
}

Deal linkage
Deal {
  lead_id
  value
  stage
}

Resulting insight

“LinkedIn posts produce fewer leads,
but close 3× higher value deals.”

This is real CRM intelligence.

8️⃣ PERMISSIONS & COMPLIANCE (CRITICAL)

Tokens encrypted

Refresh tokens server-only

Per-platform posting permissions

Audit logs per post

Manual approval toggle (AI safety)

🚀 What you now have

With this setup, your platform can:

Post like Buffer

Attribute like HubSpot

Analyze like Salesforce-lite

Scale like a SaaS

🔥 NEXT (natural continuation)

I can now:

Generate Edge Function code per platform

Design Social Account Connection UI

Add approval workflows

Build rate-limit & retry logic

Extend this to TikTok / X / WhatsApp Business

Say the word — this is now a real product build, not theory 💪
